Isle Headline is an high-quality serif typeface family, drawn by Måns Grebäck during 2018 and 2019. 

It is a sharp font with a clear and attentive look, adapted for headlines, titles and large type settings. 

It comes in four weights, each one as italic, totaling in eight styles: 
Light and Light Italic, Medium and Medium Italic, Bold and Bold Italic, Black and Black Italic. 

The font family can be used in a combination with a font of a different style, or together with its 
sister font Isle Body, also a serif font, which has the same basic structure but with a softer look
and adapted for body text and smaller type. 

Each style contains ligatures and support for a wide range of languages.
